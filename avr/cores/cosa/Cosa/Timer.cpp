 * Measured timings, deduced from Timer0 cycles with 16MHz MCU clock*
 *
 * After making any code changes in RTC or Timer, you may want to re-measure
 * the times for various Timer operations by using a test program such as
 * CosaBenchmarkRTCTimer.ino.  The procedure is as follows:
 * (1) Reduce all xxx_US constants to 16 instructions.
 * (2) Rebuild and run a test program to obtain new values.
 * (3) Rebuild and verify that actual times are 0-2 timer cycles *greater*
 *     than the expiration times.  The actual time includes returning from 
 *     the interrupt and calling micros() for the stop time, so the
 *     actual time should always report taking a little longer than requested.
